On the eve of the Federal Reserve's announcement of interest rate decisions, the market has truly begun to accept the statement that "higher interest rates will be maintained for a longer period of time".
Overnight US bond yields continued their recent upward trend, with the 10-year US bond yield reaching its highest level since 2007 and the 2-year yield approaching its highest level in more than a decade.

The basket of US dollar index DXY, which measures against six major currencies, once fell below the 105 mark, but eventually rose by 0.07%. This is the 9th consecutive week of the index's rise and also the 
longest continuous upward trend in nearly a decade.

In addition, according to the FedWatch tool under the CME Group, the probability that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates unchanged at the remaining three monetary policy meetings this year has 
risen to 99.0%, 70.8%, and 59.8%, respectively. Investors also expect that the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates in June next year is only 50.1%, which is lower than over 80% a month ago.

## Evidence of "longer-term higher interest rates"
Some analysts saw clues from last week's inflation data that the Federal Reserve will maintain high interest rates for a longer period of time. Due to a sharp rebound in oil prices, the overall CPI in the 
United States increased by 3.7% year-on-year in August, rebounding for the second consecutive month, and the month-on-month increase hit a 14-month high. When excluding the highly volatile energy and food 
categories, the core CPI in August rose by 0.3%, accelerating for the first time in six months and higher than economists' forecast of 0.2%. In response, Julie Biel, investment portfolio manager and senior 
research analyst at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said that this supports the view that interest rates will remain at higher levels for a longer period of time, as inflation remains relatively high in some areas.

In addition, a series of recent US economic data has shown resilience, delaying the expected date of interest rate cuts in the market. For example, the US non-manufacturing ISM in August exceeded expectations, 
reaching 54.5, a six-month high, and US non-farm employment increased by 187,000, exceeding expectations. Karl Schamotta, Chief Market Strategist at Corpay, previously stated that "the US economy continues to 
challenge widespread skepticism, and sustained upward surprises are pushing yields higher." It is worth mentioning that the US workers' strike movement is in full swing, igniting concerns in the market about 
economic recession and upward inflation. Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects that if UAW members of the "Big Three" in Detroit launch a comprehensive strike, the US quarterly
GDP may be hit by 1.7 percentage points.

Michael Hartnett, a Bank of America analyst, believes that the 2020s will be an era of inflation and rising interest rates, and worker strikes are one of the three major reasons. Unions have become a core driver 
of inflation. High US deficits and geopolitics will also put upward pressure on interest rates and inflation. However, US Treasury Secretary Yellen stated that the overall US economy has not shown signs of an 
impending recession and is still in a "healthy" state, with industrial output rising and inflation falling. Yellen also said that it is too early to judge the impact of the auto industry strike on the economy,
which largely depends on how long the strike lasts and who is affected.

In addition, although Federal Reserve Chairman Powell made a tough statement at the Jackson Hole Global Central Bank Annual Meeting, he did not say anything surprising - the Fed will continue to rely on data while
waiting for inflation to fall back to 2%.
Keeping interest rates at high levels for a long time may provide support for the US dollar, but it's not good news for technology stocks, especially those with high valuations. According to FactSet data, the 
information technology industry's P/E ratio was 25.5 times the expected P/E ratio for the next 12 months late last week, higher than 20 times at the end of last year and also higher than the 10-year average of 
18.5 times. Among them, the expected P/E ratio of Nvidia, the biggest winner in the technology sector this year, is 31.7 times, while Microsoft and Apple have expected P/E ratios of 29.9 times and 26.9 times 
respectively.

Large technology stocks in the non-essential consumer goods industry appear to be even more expensive. Amazon's P/E ratio is 50.1 times, and Tesla's P/E ratio is 63.8 times.

For years, investors' enthusiasm for technology stocks has been driven not only by innovation in software and hardware companies, but also by the push of ultra-low interest rates, which make the future profits 
promised by these companies particularly valuable. Therefore, investors are willing to pay higher prices for future returns.

Last year, when the Federal Reserve began to significantly increase interest rates to curb inflation, the game rules were reversed. By the end of 2022, the technology sector of the S&P 500 index had fallen by 29%, 
becoming cheaper relative to earnings, and for the first time since 2013 was lower than the S&P 500 index.

Regarding this, John Davi, CEO and CIO of Astoria Portfolio Advisors, said:

For a world with higher real interest rates and higher inflation, there is a new script, and just because something has worked in the past 10 years doesn't mean it will work in the next few years.
