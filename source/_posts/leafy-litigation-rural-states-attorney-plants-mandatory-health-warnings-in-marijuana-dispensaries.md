In 23 states, marijuana is permitted for recreational purposes while in 40 states, it is allowed for medical use. However, Patrick Kenneally, the State's Attorney in McHenry County, IL, has taken a firm stance by declaring that he will take legal action against dispensaries that do not display his health risk warnings in a prominent manner.

Dispensaries are required to caution customers about the potential mental health risks that may be linked to marijuana use, such as depression, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts, according to a press release from the State's Attorney. The Attorney has threatened to take legal action against any dispensary that fails to comply with this requirement. McHenry County, located 50 miles northwest of Chicago, is the sole jurisdiction in the United States to have implemented such regulations thus far.

## Is it a protective stance or a political move?

In Illinois, there is a conflict of ideologies between the predominantly Republican rural and non-urban areas and the Democratic cities like Chicago and Springfield. McHenry County has always been a stronghold for the Republican party, and its representative Kenneally shares their views. The state's governor, who is a progressive Democrat, has rarely seen eye-to-eye with Kenneally, resulting in heated rhetoric between them. It could be argued that political bias plays a role in this situation.

On the other hand, the State's Attorney strongly asserts that his decision is for the benefit of all consumers. By referring to recent research and findings, he contends that the general public lacks a comprehensive understanding of the potential hazards and risks involved. He accuses the Mary Jane industry of promoting specific health benefits and even disguising dispensaries with unsupported medical terminology and appearance.
